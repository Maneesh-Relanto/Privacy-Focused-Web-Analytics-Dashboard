## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Privacy by Design
✅ **No Cookies** - Never sets any tracking cookies  
✅ **No Fingerprinting** - Only uses hashed IP addresses for visitor identification  
✅ **Session-Based Storage** - Data expires with browser session  
✅ **No Cross-Site Tracking** - Each website is completely isolated  
✅ **Transparent Collection** - Clear documentation on what data is collected  
✅ **Self-Hosted Option** - Full control and data ownership  

### Backend Security
✅ **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based API authentication  
✅ **Password Hashing** - Bcryptjs for secure password storage  
✅ **CORS Protection** - Proper cross-origin request validation  
✅ **Protected Routes** - Authentication middleware on API endpoints  
✅ **Input Validation** - Zod schemas for request validation  

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data (passwords, tokens) are hashed/encrypted
- SQLite database contains only aggregated visitor data
- No Personal Identifiable Information (PII) collected via tracking
- Data access requires authentication

## 💡 Philosophy

PrivacyMetrics is built on the principle that analytics don't require invasive tracking. We believe:

- **Privacy is a right** - Not a feature to be negotiated
- **Transparency matters** - Users deserve to know what data is collected
- **Data ownership** - Your data should be on your own servers
- **Open source** - Code should be auditable and trustworthy
- **Minimal data** - Collect only what's necessary
