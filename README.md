## 🎯 Agenda

PrivacyMetrics exists to solve a critical problem in the web analytics space: **most analytics tools force you to choose between insights and privacy**.

### The Problem We Solve

Many traditional analytics platforms require:

- ❌ Tracking users across multiple sites
- ❌ Storing personal identifiable information (PII)
- ❌ Complex compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and privacy regulations
- ❌ Vendor lock-in with proprietary data formats
- ❌ High costs and complex setup processes
- ❌ Slow performance with bloated scripts (100KB+)

### Our Vision

**Developers deserve analytics that:**

- ✅ Respects user privacy by default
- ✅ Is privacy-compliant out of the box (GDPR, CCPA ready)
- ✅ Can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure
- ✅ Has minimal performance impact (2KB)
- ✅ Provides the insights you actually need
- ✅ Is open source and transparent
- ✅ Is simple to set up and maintain

## 🚀 Why PrivacyMetrics?

### 1. **Privacy First, Not an Afterthought**

Unlike most analytics platforms in the market, we **never collect PII**. No cookies, no tracking pixels, no fingerprinting. Just clean, privacy-respecting analytics.

```
Traditional Analytics:
User → Tracking Pixel → Third-party Server → PII Database → Compliance Issues

PrivacyMetrics:
User → Minimal Event → Your Server → Anonymous Analytics → Complete Control
```

### 2. **Complete Data Ownership**

Your analytics stay on **your servers**. No third-party vendor access. No data exports for compliance. No surprise policy changes.

- Host on your own infrastructure
- Own 100% of your data
- Never rely on external vendors
- Full control over data retention and deletion

### 3. **Lightweight & Fast**

**Only 2KB** of JavaScript vs 100KB+ for traditional solutions.

| Feature           | PrivacyMetrics | Traditional Solutions  |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| Script Size       | 2KB            | 100KB+                 |
| First Load Impact | Minimal        | Noticeable             |
| CLS Impact        | None           | Potential              |
| Privacy Compliant | Yes            | Requires Configuration |
| Self-Hosted       | Yes            | No                     |

### 4. **Compliance Built In**

- ✅ GDPR compliant by default (no consent banner needed)
- ✅ CCPA ready
- ✅ No cross-site tracking
- ✅ No personal data collection
