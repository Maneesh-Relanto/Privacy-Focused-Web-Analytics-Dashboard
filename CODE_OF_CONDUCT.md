## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces — GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and any other official project channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Maneesh-Relanto/Privacy-Focused-Web-Analytics-Dashboard/issues) or contacting the maintainers directly through GitHub.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
